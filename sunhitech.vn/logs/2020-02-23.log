,N'Hello my name is David,

I wish to first start by stating your site is awesome!

I feel like you can use a bit more text material though.. and I know it''s quite annoying developing it all yourself.

Do you by chance also have issues making Reports, Guides, Digital Info for you product & services or even E-BOOKS?

Simple things like even including an E-book can help you gain thousands of brand-new leads per month!

Think of if you could do it all in the press of one button?

New innovative technology has actually JUST been introduced that allows you to INSTANTLY create expert Ebooks, Reports, Guides, Lead Magnets, Whitepapers, and digital info-products AUTOMATICALLY, and "ON-DEMAND" ... at a push of a button!

This is not spam, I simply took great pride in the development of this application and if you aren''t satisfied you get your refund!

It''ll  include CONTENT for you! (Saving you time and $100''s or $1000''s in contracting out costs.).

Develop your list quicker, offer to your customers, or perhaps to your customers as a service for $150 to $600, thanks to the "Commercial License" AND company site that''s consisted of as a bonus!'
